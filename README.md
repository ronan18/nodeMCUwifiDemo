# Node MCU Wifi Demo

This demo was created to illustrate how to create a basic node MCU program to fetch instructions from a server.

### Setup
- Install libraries for the server by running `npm i` in the nodeJsServer directory
- Start the server by running `npm run start` in the server directory
- Go to the address specified in the console
- Copy that ip address into the server variable in the node MCU code in the nodeMCUcode directory
- Download the code from the nodeMCUcode directory onto the board
- Start up the Node MCU
